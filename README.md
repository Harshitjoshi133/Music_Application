Hi it is a Music Player created by me , It was Fun beginner level project, I will update comments soon in the code , feel free to learn using it.
I'm worked for 1-2 week in this project , to run it properly ,You will need ANDROID STUDIO
It searches all the music in your system, and displays it.
It has 5 button: 1 button to play and pause, 1 button to play next song , 1 button to play previous song, 1 button to move 10s forward , 1 button to move 10s backward
It has a fully responsive seek bar.
